        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I first encountered programming during my school and university studies, but afterward, I worked in completely
          different
          fields. A couple of years ago, I had the chance to try my hand at web development, and now I’m looking to
          learn
          more
          about quality coding. The structure and logic behind code appeal to me, and I enjoy the learning process,
          especially
          in
          the supportive atmosphere of RS School.
        </p>
        <p>Finding a job one day would help cover my cat's plane tickets and vet bills, but maintaining realistic
          expectations is essential, so I’m focusing on studying as much as I can for now.

        <h2>Code example</h2>
        <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/526571aae218b8ee490006f4" target="_blank">Bit counting</a>
        <p>The function countBits takes a non-negative integer n as input and returns the number of 1 bits in its binary
          representation. For example, for the input 1234, which is represented as 10011010010 in binary, the function
          returns 5
          because there are five 1 bits.</p>
        <pre>
          <code>const countBits = (n) => n.toString(2).split('0').join('').length;</code>
        </pre>
